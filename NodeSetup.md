#Setup Node JS

##Installing Node

On Ubuntu you can install Node JS from the command line using ```apt-get```.

You should already have it installed on your laptop if you completed the codeX February 2015 intro.

The installation instructions are as follows:

* ```sudo apt-get install node-legacy``` 
* ```sudo apt-get install npm```

Open a terminal window:

* type ```nodejs``` and press enter - you should now be in a Node JS console - you should get no errors. (on a non Ubuntu machine the command is called ```node```). Use ctrl-C to get out of it
* type ```npm``` you should see some information about npm on the console

Now you are ready to use Javascript from the command line. 

##Node JS Javascript from the command line

Let's run a simple javascript script from the command line:

	* Create a file called 'hello.js' 
	* copy this text into the file: 'console.log('hello world!');'
	* Save the file
	* now run it using 'nodejs hello.js'
	* what happens?

So what just happend? You liberated your Javascript knowledge from the command line. 

Now proof this to yourself and write some Javascript that use:
* an ```if``` statement
* a ```for``` loop
* write a simple function
* what else you need to get comfortable

If you can create about 5 different javascript file (.js) files to get more comfortable with Javascript on the command line.

You can run the scripts using ```nodejs filename.js```

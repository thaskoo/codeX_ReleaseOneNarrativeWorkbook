#Try this

Now that you have a better idea about what Node JS are try to install and use some modules from npmjs.org.

These modules to try out is:

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-animation
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet
 
Be sure to create a ```NarrativeWorkbook``` folder in your projects folder.
* in that create a ```modules101``` folder
* then type ```npm init``` - follow along, you will need to press enter a few times, you can change the defaults if you like
* in the ```modules101``` folder there should be package.json file - see what it looks like.
* node install the figlet module using this command: ```npm install --save figlet```
* check how the package file changed
* now write a program using the figlet module to display 'codeX is cool!'
* take a look on the figlet npmjs.org page to see how to use it.
* Now use the text-animation module and animate 'codeX is cool'. Pro-tip: you'll need to install it first

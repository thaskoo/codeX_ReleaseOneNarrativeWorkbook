# Data Modelling and Persistence

Applications needs a way of storing and manipulating data, that is what databases are for. Databases makes 
it easy to store, structure, retrieve and manage data.

## Database basics

Databases put data that belongs together in tables, each table have multiple entries with is called rows and 
each row have multiple fields.

One can link tables using fields, by creating a field in one table and referencing that field 
from another table. These ields are used to create relationships between tables, that's why it is called relational databases.

### Database components

* Tables
* Rows
* Fields
* Keys
 * Primary key - a field that makes a row unique
 * Foreign key - a field that reference a key in another table

## Data Modelling

The process of creating a set of data entities that describes a problem domain is called Data Modelling. When creating a data model one looks at what different entities needs to be stored and how they relate to each other. Entities are created as tables that contains rows, each row contains some fields which is the specific data that is stored and fields are used as keys (foreign keys) to map relationships between entities.

Look at this scenario:

> As as Taxi Owner I would like to see who is driving my taxi's and on which routes.

Answer these questions:
  * For what entities do we need to store data?
  * What data do we need for each entity?
  * How do the entities relate to each other?

Once the above questions are answered one have the basic information for creating a data model. Once one have a data model one can create a database. 

## SQL

Once one have a database one needs a way of manipulating the data in the database. One needs to be able to insert, query, update and delete the data, this is where SQL comes in.

SQL stands for Structured Query Language, it's a data manipulation language that allows one to easily find (query) and create data. SQL have 4 basic operations insert, delete, update and select. The ```select``` operation being the one to find existing datat in the database the other operations are self explenatory. One use the fields in the tables to link tables together.

## CRUD - create, read, update and delete

One can use SQL to create some CRUD screens to manipulates data.

## Learn it

Now that you have a basic high level understanding of database bases and SQL work your way through this tutorial:

## Aggregating data

Once your data is in a database you can use it to calculate aggregates like averages, max or min values.

## MySQL

For our project we will use the widely used open source MySQL database:

Here is a basic tutorial to get going:

## MySQL and Node JS

Now let's see how to use MySQL with NodeJS to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) data.

Work your way through this example:

## Data model & CRUD for Nelisa

Now use your database knowledge to:

* create a data model for Nelisa's Spaza Shop
* create a MySQL database this datamodel
* import the CSV files you have from Nelisa into the database
* change your web application to use the database

### Import data using a sqldump file:

One can use the ```mysqldump``` utility to export and import data into a database. There is a mysql dump file added to  this repository that you can use as a starting point for your Nelisa's database, it's called ```Spaza-MySQL-Dump.sql```. 

You can use it like this

Type in the terminal:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

Then do:

```
mysql> create database <you db name>;
mysql> use <your db name>;
mysql> source Spaza-MySQL-Dump.sql;
```

You can import the dump file from the terminal using ```mysqldump``` as well.

After importing the dump file into your database you should have two tables in your database:
* sales_csv
* stock_purchases_csv

## Next steps

Now that you have a database that contains the data from the CSV file we have a base to start our datamodel from. When creating a datamodel one needs to be sure that one removes all repetition, when changing the product name one should only need to do it in one place. The process of removing data repitition is called Normalization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_normalization). So we need to create tables for all the different entities and and be sure they relate to each other correctly. Relationships between tables are created using fields, a primary key in one table can be stored as  foreign key table in another table to create a datamodel. Datamodels enables us to reflect the data storage needs of systems to store and retrieve data effectively.

###To populate the database:

* Create a datamodel that includes a table for Sales, Purchases, Products, Categories and Suppliers. 
   * Be sure that the tables relates to each other correctly using foreign keys.
   * The datamodel should be created using a script file. A text file with a .sql extension, store this file in the root of your project.
   
* Populate the datamodel using the data in the CSV tables
   * Populate Products & Categories:  
     * Create insert scripts to create data for the Categories table
     * Create insert scripts that will create Products linked to their Categories
        * You can create the distinct sql statement to create a unique list of Products  
   * Populate the Sales table:
     * Use the ```sales_csv``` table joined with the ```Products``` table to insert the correct foreign keys into the Products table
     * Use a insert statement with a select statement - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5391344/insert-with-select
     * Join the ```sales_csv``` and the ```Products``` table on the product name column to get the product id to use as the foreign key in the Products table. 
   *  Populate the Sales & Supplier tables
     * Populate the Supplier tables from the data in the ```stock_purchases_csv``` table - use the select insert method described above. Using ```select distict``` will help you to get a unique list of suppliers.
     * Join the Products and the Suppliers tables using the Product and Supplier Names to get the appropriate foreign keys. 

###Use the database

Now use the datase you just created to answers Nelisa's questions about her data. You will need to use joins to use data from the various tables. Aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT and AVERAGE in combination with the ```GROUP BY``` clause will make it easy for you to calculate the most popular product and category and the other data Nelisa requires.
